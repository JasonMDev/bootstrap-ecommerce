# Bootstrap eCommerce

## Introduction
A demo eCommerce product page by leveraging best practises from the HTML5 Boilerplate along with Bootstrap.

This is based on the book [*Bootstrap Site Blueprints*](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/bootstrap-site-blueprints) written by David Cochran, Ian Whitley and published in Feb 2014. 

The general outline was followed, however the latest versions of the HTML5 boilerplate and bootstrap libraries at the time were used.

## Feautures
These are some of the feautures that have been added to the web page (*text used and/or modified from above mentioned book*):
*   Employed Bootstrap styles to quickly set up breadcrumbs, a page title, and
pagination customized according to our needs
*   Adjusted Bootstrap grid styles to create a visually pleasing grid of product
items, all of the same height so as to ensure a regular grid
*   Styled a complex Clearance Sale button with @brand-feature red
background color
*   Used the styles from the btn class to make our filter options more easily
clickable, while customizing the styles to suit our needs
*   Used Bootstrap column classes with responsive adjustments to arrange our
options list items optimally for multiple viewport widths
